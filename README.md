## Description of the project
This project implements a Machine Learning Pipeline for data classification, using PyTorch. It
trains a neural network (`SimpleNet`) on the `diabetes_risk.csv` dataset. Also, while it is 
training, it tracks progeression and generate exploratory and evaluation metrics.

## Data source
It is `diabetes_risk.csv`, which it has been downloaded from Kaggle, a public Machine Learning
Repository. It is locally stored in `data/raw/diabetes_risk.csv`

## Installation & Environment Setup 
```
This project uses `uv` for lightning-fast dependency management and reproducibility.

1. Install `uv` (if not already installed):
   `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
2. Sync the environment and install dependencies:
   `uv sync`
3. Run the training script:
   `uv run python -m practice_sdoml.modeling.train`
```

## Execution & usage instructions
### Data exploration
Inspect the exploration notebook with feature distributions and data observations:
```bash
jupyter lab notebooks/1_exploration.ipynb
```

### Model training
Run the training loop and monitor the loss decrease:
```bash
uv run python -m practice_sdoml.modeling.train
```

### Performance evaluation & figures
Compute evaluation metrics and generate report artifacts in `reports/figures/`:
```bash
uv run python -m practice_sdoml.modeling.evaluate
```

## Documentation
Sphinx HTML documentation is located in `docs/build/html/`.

To recompile the documentation:
```bash
cd docs
uv run sphinx-build -b html source build/html
```

## Branch management & collaboration guides
Contributions follow the standard feature branch workflow:

1. Create a feature branch from: `main`: `git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>`.
2. Make meaningful commits with clear messages.
3. Merge back into `main` using explicit merge commits or pull requests.
